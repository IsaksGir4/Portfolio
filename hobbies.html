                <p>
                    Since I discovered Transformers, this franchise became a source of inspiration for my creativity.
                    Not only was I fascinated by its universe, but I took it further, creating my own stories and developing
                    unique, detailed, and functional plasticine figures. Each design reflects my personal vision,
                    combining precision and originality to give life to characters with my own style.

                <p>
                    Video games have been much more than a hobby for me; they have been a gateway to creativity and exploration.
                    They have allowed me to experience situations beyond reality, pushing my imagination and my ability to
                    solve problems in innovative ways.

                <p>
                    Recently, I have begun to delve into the world of investments, exploring it in a self-taught and strategic way.
                    I have deepened my knowledge through study and continuous learning, applying what I have learned with the
                    objective of building a strategy that will allow me to obtain sustainable returns.
