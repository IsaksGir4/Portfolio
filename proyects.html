                        I participated in the first Hackathon competition organized by ISA Intercolombia, where I had the opportunity to work in a team in a real-time problem-solving environment. Although we did not manage to qualify, the experience allowed us to strengthen our skills in data analytics, strategic analysis and intuition, applying them to the challenges posed. It was also a valuable opportunity to understand the workings and dynamics of collaborative work in competitive environments.

                        In the Engineering Project III course, I developed a research focused on the implementation of the STEM system in educational institutions. As part of the project, we conducted an analysis based on the opinion of several schools that already apply this approach, with the aim of identifying effective strategies to improve educational levels in the city and, potentially, at the national level. This experience allowed me to deepen my understanding of the impact of STEM education and to formulate proposals for its optimization and expansion.

                        Together with a group of colleagues and with the support of the Innovation Director, we developed a Makerspace focused on providing services for conducting experiments. This space allows companies to reduce significant costs in testing and prototyping, optimizing resources and avoiding excessive investments in specialized tools. Through this initiative, we facilitate access to infrastructure and know-how that drive innovation and business development.
